# ABCDE FPGA Board Projects

Welcome to the official repository for the **ABCDE Board** projects. This board is based on an FPGA architecture and serves as a platform for developing and running custom digital logic projects.

### üß† What is ABCDE?

The **ABCDE Board** (short for *Any Buddy Can Design Electronics*) is a custom FPGA-based development board created to demonstrate how FPGAs can serve as both **programmable logic** and **microcontroller alternatives**. Compared to traditional microcontrollers (MCUs), **FPGAs offer superior performance, power efficiency, and flexibility**, making them ideal for high-speed or parallel processing tasks.

## üìÅ Project List

- **DAC/**  
  Digital-to-Analog Converter implemented using PWM techniques and FPGA logic.

- **HEX_KEYPAD/**  
  Scanning and decoding a hexadecimal keypad through matrix-style input using Verilog.

- **LCD/**  
  Driving a standard character LCD using custom FSMs (Finite State Machines) designed in Verilog/VHDL.

- **LCD_KEYPAD/**  
  Combines the LCD and Keypad interface to create a basic user interface for input/output on the FPGA.

- **LED_MANAGEMENT/**  
  Includes multiple LED control modules such as blinking patterns, binary counters, and status indicators.
